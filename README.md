# Employee_Database_challenge

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to help the HR department determine what the future looks like for the company in terms of employees and when they will be retriring. Our analysis will help them detemine next steps.

## Results
While looking through the data, I can make a few observations.
- From the "retiring_titles" analysis, it is clear that there is going to be a lot of Senior Staff and Engineers retiring. That sort of experienced employees will need to be replaced. 
- Per the same analysis, there will be a large number of engineers of all levels retiring soon. They need to make sure as a company that there are plenty of engineers available internally or externally to replace them.
- Only 2 Managers will be retiring, but the company will need to make sure someone else is trained to take over before they retire.
- There are a ton of employees, 1549 in total, that are eligible for mentorship opportuntities. These would be good people to train to take over retiring employees. 

## Summary
- How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact? - In total, they will need to fill 72,458 roles.
- Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees? Yes, I would say so as there are only 1,549 eligible for mentorship opportunities.
- One other table we created that showed some worisome forecast, was the managers_by_dept as it showed there were only 5 active managers for 9 departments. That tells me there will need to be more managers hired not only because there are 4 open slots but becasue there are 2 more in the "silver tsunami".
- Another thing I would like to learn is the salaries for the retiring group so the company can understand what money will be avaialbe to fill those roles.
